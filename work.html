                    Printing to the Terminal: 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    I first started coding with Code Nation. The first thing I learned was how to print to the terminal in Python. 
                    The picture on the left shows some examples of the work I carried out while learning this piece of code. 
                </p>

            <div class = "variables"> 
                <img class = "python_v" src="variables.png"> 
                <p class = "variables_text"> 
                    Variables: 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    After printing to the terminal I learned about variables and the various ways they can be used. My favourite way 
                    of printing variables to a terminal is through the use of an F string (as demonstrated in the left picture). 
                </p> 
            </div> 
            <br> 
            <div class = "functions"> 
                <img class = "python_f" src="functions.png">
                <p class = "functions_text"> 
                    Functions: 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    After learning about variables I learned about functions. Function activites were the one component of Python that I 
                    struggled with the most. However, with time and practice I understood how to use them properly. The first activity 
                    consisted of creating a function that would output the pizza order and order number to the terminal. 
                </p>

            <div class = "ifelse"> 
                <img class = "python_if" src="ifelse.png"> 
                <p class = "ifelse_text"> 
                    If else: 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    "If else" statements were my favourite piece of code to learn. I like that it needed to meet a condition in order to work. 
                    In the challenges for if else statements, I learned how to see if the length of a password is too short or if a number is
                    fully divisible by another and many more activities similar to that.

            <div class = "lists">

                    Lists: 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    On the course I learned about lists and the various ways lists can be modified/changed. In activity 1 I used the 
                    .append() and .pop() to add and remove items from my list. In other activities I used code such as .sort() and 
                    .count(). 
                </p> 
            </div>

                    Loops: 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    Loops were also another part of learning Python that I enjoyed, but are also something that I felt I needed more practice with. 
                    Activity 1 created a loop which would output the list to the terminal. If the 3rd film in the list was Ghostbusters, the terminal 
                    would print "Yey it's Ghostbusters." if it wasn't it would print "boo, we want Ghostbusters."

                    Trello: 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    One of the project management software I used was Trello. Trello allowed me to clearly see what needed to be done, what's in progress 
                    and what is complete. Trello can be customised to anything you want but I was taught to use Trello with the "Kanban" method. I found 
                    this software very helpful for group work as it allowed me to assign group members to specific tasks.

                    <br> 
                    Another planning software I used was a website called "Draw.io". It can get quite annoying as arrows don't always go where you want
                    them too. But it is an ideal free software for making flow charts. Creating a flow chart allowed me to clearly plan 
                    how my project was going to go. Me and two others worked on the flow chart for a text-based adventure game. A snippet of 
                    this flow chart is shown on the right.

        <h3>Python Text-Based Game</h3> 
        <div class = "ghoul_text_game">

                My First Game: 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                During my time at Code Nation I created a text-based adventure game with two other students on the course. Using all the techniques 
                I had learned from "Python Fundamentals" and "Project Managment/Planning". Since I enjoy gaming I enjoyed making this, as games design has
                always been something that has interested me. We had one day to plan the game and two days to code the game. Me and my team members all 
                agreed that the project went well considering the short time frame we had. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                Coding the game consisted mainly of if else statements, which were dependent on what the player chose to do. The main storyline of the game 
                consisted of a group of young adults, deciding to stay the night at a haunted house. The young adults decide to use a Ouija board which summons 
                a friendly ghost that speaks of another aggressive ghost in the home called "The Lady in Grey". The player is one of the young adults and must
                banish the Lady by collecting items to use in a ritual. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                We decided to go with the name "Ghoul Busters" as a play on words from Ghost Busters and chose the horror genre as we were making it over the 
                Halloween period. Shard studios has no significance but was chosen to be the name of our group. I would love to do something like this again 
                but try it individually as I could put more time into it and I would be eager to see what I come up with.

        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <div class = "html_css"> 
            <div class = "html">

            <p class = "html_text"> 
                HTML: 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                During my time at Code Nation I have learned the basics of HTML and how HTML works with CSS. A lot of HTML code consisted of div's, headers, 
                paragraphs, classes, breaks and id's. I have enjoyed learning how websites are made. 
                <br> 
            </p>
            </div>
            <br> 
            <br> 
            <div class = "css"> 
                <img class = "css_img" src = "css.png">
                <p class = "css_text"> 
                    CSS: 
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    So far I have learned from being with Code Nation how CSS compliments HTML. It has been difficult to get my head around how pictures and 
                    text are moved but through research and experimentation I understood. The main components of CSS I have used are: margins, borders, width,
                    flex-box, id's, classes, font-size, color and text-align.
