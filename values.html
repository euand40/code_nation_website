            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p class = "my_story">
                Throughout the past five years of my life my experience has been purely academic.
                This journey first started after highschool when I decided to enrole on a Level 3 BTEC in Construction and the Built Environment.
                On this course I did very well and enjoyed my experience, so after taking the course I decided to go to University studying Quantity Surveying. 
                Again through hard work and determination I did very well, however I didn't enjoy my experience at University all that well.
                <br> 
                <br> 
                This made me evaluate my life choices and wonder if construction was really for me.
                To help aid this decision the COVID19 pandemic occured just as I had graduated, leaving me in competition with other
                more experienced construction professionals. This was a turning point for me. 
                While looking and applying to Construction jobs, I felt like none of the jobs I had looked at or applied for resonated with me,   
                I decided my heart wasn't in it and chose to look elsewhere. This is where IT/Technology came in. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                I have always been passionate about technology. I have a basic knowledge of computer hardware, love to game and have always been interested in how games and software are made. However, I always thought that if I took a degree in a specific 
                subject. I wouldn't have the option to do something else. So when my work coach for universal credit told me about a three week coding course with Code Nation that they could fund, I was first of all shocked that I was given the opportunity 
                to do something like that and eager to learn about something I had always been passionate about. Which leads us to the now, where I am continuing to pursue what I am passionate about in hopes I can kickstart a career in the IT/Technology sector. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                Moral of my story, to anyone who is stuck with what they should do for a career is to follow what you are passionate about. Listen and understand the signs you are telling yourself. If you are following a career path or any path for that matter 
                where you feel miserable or you are telling others "I wish I had done that with my life" go and do it! But be smart about your choices, if you are thinking of quitting a stable job for a new career path, ease into it first and be absolutely sure 
                it is what you want. If anything use the qualifications/experience gained from your previous role as a back up if things go South.

            <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
            <p class = "interests"> 
                Most of my time is spent at the computer. I love to game, some of my favourite games consist of: The Assassins Creed franchise, 
                Middle Earth: Shadow of War, Portal and The Elder Scrolls series. I do also enjoy going outside, especially for walks and going 
                out on my bike. I enjoy nature, it's always a nice feeling to be outside and feel the fresh air after staying inside on the 
                computer. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                One of my most recent hobbies is listening to audio books. I've always enjoyed books but I struggle to find the time to sit down 
                and read, so listening to audio books through audible is the next best thing to me. The last book I finished listening to 
                was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, read by Stephen Fry. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                Before COVID, I used to go to adult karate classes every Tuesday and Thursday. Currently I am a purple belt, with my next belt being the first 
                section of brown belt. I believe there are 3 sections in total. It was a really good way of keeping fit and I loved the social aspect 
                as the people in my classes are all really nice and I get on with them well.

            <h3>Values</h3>
            <p class = "values"> 
                There is a lot of things that I value, one of the most important things is my family. I love my family and my girlfriend and always try 
                to put them first. I also value friendship and respect. I believe that it is important to show respect to the people around you especially the 
                ones that you are close to. I'm not a fan of drama and conflict, I prefer to avoid those things where I can. If I were to describe myself it 
                would be that I am quite an old soul. The majority of things people my age like to do, such as; drinking and partying, I don't particularly 
                enjoy. I prefer settings where I am with a small group of people, maybe playing games or just having a small get-to-together.
